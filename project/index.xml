      <title>SAE Latent Co-occurrence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) latents show promise as a method for extracting interpretable features from large language models (LM), but their overall utility as the foundation of mechanistic understanding of LM remains unclear. Ideal features would be linear and independent, but we show that there exist SAE latents in GPT2-Small display non-independent behaviour, especially in small SAEs. Rather, they co-occur in clusters that map out interpretable subspaces. These subspaces show latents acting compositionally, as well as being used to resolve ambiguity in language. However, SAE latents remain largely independently interpretable within these contexts despite this behaviour. Furthermore, these clusters decrease in both size and prevalence as SAE width increases, suggesting this is a phenomenon of small SAEs with coarse-grained features.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DNA Damage Repair and Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://mclarke1991.github.io/project/radiotherapy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cancers often emerge, in part, due to deficencies in DNA damage repair, making them vulnerable to DNA damaging treatments such as radiotherapy. While radiotherapy efficacy has been increasing, this is mainly due to better targeting of tumour anatomy, but targeted therapy offers the opportunity to radiosensitise tumour cells by targeting vulnerabilities in the tumour biology. We use computational modelling to find such vulnerabilities, and explore potential resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cancer evolution</title>
      <link>https://mclarke1991.github.io/project/cancer_evolution/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cancers evolve from normal cells, and continue to evolve to evade treatment. Understanding evolution from tumourigenesis will allow for earlier detection of cancer, while predicting evolution of resistance mechanisms is essential for finding treatments that are effective in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Combination therapy</title>
      <link>https://mclarke1991.github.io/project/combination_therapy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computatational modelling allows screening of thousands of combinations of drugs to find the most effective treatments. This allows for better protection against the emergence of resistance, as well as rapid drug repurposing e.g. to combat emerging diseases such as COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
