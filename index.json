However, these models are typically constructed manually using prior knowledge and can be over-reliant on study bias. These limitations hinder their ability to make accurate predictions and incorporate new evidence. Scaling up the construction of models to take advantage of increasingly abundant 'omics data can bridge these gaps by providing a comprehensive view of signalling events and how they influence cellular phenotypes. In this study, we present MAGELLAN, a method leveraging message passing graph neural networks to build computational models directly from pathway data and discrete rules representing experimental results. We used this to construct a computational model of breast cancer signalling and re-parameterize a previously published non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model, showing that MAGELLAN can predict genetic dependencies and achieve comparable model quality to expert-curated and manually trained models. Our approach enables the integration of prior knowledge networks and experimental data to build predictive models that are mechanistically interpretable. This approach simplifies model creation, making it more accessible and practical for experimentalists, and supports broader applications in drug discovery and biological research.","tags":["Cancer","Lung Cancer","Breast Cancer","Computational Modelling","Graph Neural Networks","Message Passing","Drug Discovery","Drug Response","Drug Response Prediction","BMA","BioModelAnalyzer","Combination Therapy"],"title":"MAGELLAN: Automated Generation of Interpretable Computational Models for Biological Reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

A lack of therapeutic options personalized to individual patient genetics, and the targeted therapies that exist quickly succumbing to resistance, leads to high variation in survival. Patient stratification combined with greater personalisation of therapies have the potential to improve outcomes, however, the wide variation in mutations found in NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients mean that experimentally determining suitable treatment combinations is time-consuming and expensive. Here we present an in silico model encompassing tumour intrinsic key oncogenic signalling pathways, including EGFR, AKT, JAK/STAT and WNT for efficiently predicting rational drug-drug and drug-radiotherapy combination therapies in NSCLC. Using this model, we simulate diverse genetic profiles and test over 10,000 therapeutic strategies to identify optimal strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms specific to genetic profiles and p53 status. Our in silico model reproduces drug additivity experiments, predicts radio-sensitising genes validated in a CRISPR screen and identifies 53BP1 as a potential drug target that improves the therapeutic window during radiotherapy, as well as potential to use ATM inhibitors to overcome p53 loss-of-function driven radiotherapy resistance. We further use the in silico model to identify a 19-gene signature to stratify patients most likely to benefit from radiotherapy and validated this using TCGA data. These results further demonstrate the utility of in silico mechanistic modelling and present a bespoke computational resource for large-scale screening of personalised therapies applied to NSCLC.","tags":["Cancer","Radiotherapy","DNA Damage Repair","DDR","Lung Cancer","Computational Modelling","Network Modelling","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA","Combination Therapy","Heterogeneity","Drug Discovery"],"title":"Predicting Personalised Therapeutic Combinations in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Using In Silico Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

Here, we have developed an in silico model to determine the local cross-talk between melanomas and Langerhans cells (LCs), the primary antigen-presenting cells at the site of melanoma development. The model predicts that melanomas fail to activate LC migration to lymph nodes until tumors reach a critical size, which is determined by a positive TNF-α feedback loop within melanomas, in line with our observations of murine tumors. In silico drug screening, supported by subsequent experimental testing, shows that treatment of primary tumors with MAPK pathway inhibitors may further prevent LC migration. In addition, our in silico model predicts treatment combinations that bypass LC dysfunction. In conclusion, our combined approach of in silico and in vivo studies suggests a molecular mechanism that explains how early melanomas develop under the radar of immune surveillance by LC.","tags":["Cancer","Melanoma","BioModelAnalyzer\"","Combination Therapy","Computational Modelling","Immunology","BMA"],"title":"Localized immune surveillance of primary melanoma in the skin deciphered through executable modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

The type of blood cell and the specific order of oncogenic events initiating abnormal growth ultimately determine the cancer subtype and subsequent clinical outcome. HOXA9 plays an important role in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) prognosis by promoting blood cell expansion and altering differentiation; however, the function of HOXA9 in other blood malignancies is still unclear. Here, we highlight the biological switch and prognosis marker properties of HOXA9 in AML and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). First, we establish the ability of HOXA9 to stratify AML patients with distinct cellular and clinical outcomes. Then, through the use of a computational network model of MPN, we show that the self-activation of HOXA9 and its relationship to JAK2 and TET2 can explain the branching progression of JAK2/TET2 mutant MPN patients towards divergent clinical characteristics. Finally, we predict a connection between the RUNX1 and MYB genes and a suppressive role for the NOTCH pathway in MPN diseases.","tags":["HOXA9","BMA","BioModelAnalyzer","Network modelling","Computational Biology","Cancer","AML","MPN","Acute Myeloid Leukemia","Myeloproliferative Neoplasms"],"title":"HOXA9 has the hallmarks of a biological switch with implications in blood cancers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

The urgent need for effective and affordable COVID-19 treatments calls for repurposing combinations of approved drugs. The challenge is to identify which combinations are likely to be most effective and at what stages of the disease. Here, we present the first disease-stage executable signalling network model of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions used to predict effective repurposed drug combinations for treating early- and late stage severe disease. Using our executable model, we performed in silico screening of 9870 pairs of 140 potential targets and have identified nine new drug combinations. Camostat and Apilimod were predicted to be the most promising combination in effectively supressing viral replication in the early stages of severe disease and were validated experimentally in human Caco-2 cells. Our study further demonstrates the power of executable mechanistic modelling to enable rapid pre-clinical evaluation of combination therapies tailored to disease progression. It also presents a novel resource and expandable model system that can respond to further needs in the pandemic.","tags":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","Infectious Disease","Combination therapy","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA","Drug repositioning","BMA"],"title":"Executable Network of SARS-CoV-2-Host Interaction Predicts Drug Combination Treatments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

Such models provide a means for comprehensive data integration, can be experimentally validated, are readily interpreted both biologically and clinically, and have the potential to predict effective therapies for different cancer types and subtypes. We explain what executable models are and how they can be used to represent the dynamic biological behaviours inherent in cancer, and demonstrate how such models, when coupled with automated reasoning, facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms by which oncogenic signalling pathways regulate tumours. We explore how executable models have impacted the field of cancer research and argue that extending them to represent a tumour in a specific patient (that is, an avatar) will pave the way for improved personalized treatments and precision medicine. Finally, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in developing executable models and stress that effective cross-disciplinary efforts are key to forward progress in the field.","tags":["Cancer","Computational Modelling","Network Modelling","Executable Modelling","Mathematical Modelling","Machine Learning","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA"],"title":"Executable cancer models: successes and challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

Nonetheless, tumor cells in aggressive breast cancers typically exhibit significant and stable heterogeneity in their Myc levels, which correlates with refractoriness to therapy and poor prognosis. This suggests that Myc heterogeneity confers some selective advantage on breast tumor growth and progression. To investigate this, we created a traceable MMTV-Wnt1 –driven in vivo chimeric mammary tumor model comprising an admixture of low-Myc– and reversibly switchable high-Myc–expressing clones. We show that such tumors exhibit interclonal mutualism wherein cells with high-Myc expression facilitate tumor growth by promoting protumorigenic stroma yet concomitantly suppress Wnt expression, which renders them dependent for survival on paracrine Wnt provided by low-Myc–expressing clones. To identify any therapeutic vulnerabilities arising from such interdependency, we modeled Myc/Ras/p53/Wnt signaling cross talk as an executable network for low-Myc, for high-Myc clones, and for the 2 together. This executable mechanistic model replicated the observed interdependence of high-Myc and low-Myc clones and predicted a pharmacological vulnerability to coinhibition of COX2 and MEK. This was confirmed experimentally. Our study illustrates the power of executable models in elucidating mechanisms driving tumor heterogeneity and offers an innovative strategy for identifying combination therapies tailored to the oligoclonal landscape of heterogenous tumors.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","Computational Modelling","Network Modelling","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA","WNT","COX2","MEK","MYC","Combination Therapy","Heterogeneity","HER2-","ER-"],"title":"Heterogeneity of Myc expression in breast cancer exposes pharmacological vulnerabilities revealed through executable mechanistic modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

However, little is known about the order in which mutations are acquired in successful clones. A particular sequence of mutations may confer an early selective advantage to a clone by increasing survival or proliferation, or lead to negative selection by triggering cell death. The space of allowed sequences of mutations is therefore constrained by the gene regulatory network. Here, we introduce a methodology for the systematic exploration of the effect of every possible sequence of oncogenic mutations in a cancer cell modelled as a qualitative network. Our method uses attractor identification using binary decision diagrams and can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous systems. We demonstrate our method using a recently developed model of ER-negative breast cancer. We show that there are differing levels of constraint in the order of mutations for different combinations of oncogenes, and that the effects of ErbB2/HER2 over-expression depend on the preceding mutations.","tags":["Evolution","Cancer","Tumorigenesis","Binary Decision Diagram","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA","Breast Cancer"],"title":"Using State Space Exploration to Determine How Gene Regulatory Networks Constrain Mutation Order in Cancer Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew A.

This heterogeneity poses a challenge for treatment, as this variety serves to ensure there is almost always a portion of the cells which are resistant to any one targeted therapy. This can be avoided by combining therapies, but finding viable combinations experimentally is expensive and time-consuming. However, there is also cooperation between sub-clones, and being able to better model and predict these dynamics could allow this interdependence to be exploited.\nIn order to investigate how best to tackle tumour heterogeneity, while avoiding acquired resistance, I have developed the first comprehensive computational model of the gene regulatory network in breast cancer focused on the c-myc oncogene and the differences between sub-clones. I model the system as a discrete, qualitative network, which can reproduce the conditions in heterogeneous tumours, as well as predict the effect of perturbations mimicking mutations or application of therapy.\nTogether with experimental collaborators, I apply my computational model to an _in vivo_ mouse model of MMTV-Wnt1 driven breast cancer, which has high and low c-myc expressing sub-clones. I show that the computational model is able to reproduce the behaviour of this system, and predict how best to target either one sub-clone individually or the tumour as a whole. I show how combination therapies offer more paths to attack the tumour, and how two drugs can work synergistically. For example, I predict how Mek inhibition will preferentially affect one sub-clone, but the addition of COX2 inhibition improves effectiveness across the tumour as a whole.\nIn this thesis, I show how a computational network model can predict treatments in breast cancer, and assess the effects on different clones of different treatment combinations. This model can be easily extended with new data, as well as adapted to different types of cancer. This therefore represents a novel method to find viable combination therapies computationally and speed up the development of new cancer treatments.","tags":["Cancer","Breast Cancer","Computational Modelling","Network Modelling","BioModelAnalyzer","BMA","WNT","COX2","MEK","MYC","Combination Therapy","Heterogeneity","HER2-","ER-"],"title":"Predictive Computational Modelling of the c-myc Gene Regulatory Network for Combinatorial Treatments of Breast Cancer","type":"publication"}]
