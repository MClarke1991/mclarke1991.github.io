              I am continuing my work on DNA damage repair as part of [CRUKRadNet](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/research/strategic/radnet), applying this to breast cancer and lung cancer. I am also developing new methods for studying cancer evolution. During the pandemic, my colleagues and I demonstrated [how our work on cancer could be applied to infectious disease](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00561-5.pdf), to predict drug repurposing for rapid response to the COVID-19 epidemic. 
              
              
              Responsibilities include:
        
              * Building network models by collating data on biochemical interactions in collaboration with experimental partners.
              * Development of new methods for the generation and analysis of executable network models. 
              * Supervision of undergraduate and Master's students. 
              * Mentoring new members of the lab.
              * Presenting at international conferences. 
              * Developing and maintaining research software developed and used by the lab.
              * Lab Management.

              With funding from [CRUK RadNet](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/research/strategic/radnet), I worked on modelling the DNA damage response pathway to find radiosensitising drug treatments. I also continued my work on breast cancer, focussing on the triple-negative sub-type (TNBC) as part of a collaboration with the [Mark Foundation for Cancer Research](https://themarkfoundation.org/) and [PARTNER clinical trial](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-looking-at-olaparib-with-chemotherapy-for-early-breast-cancer-partner).  In collaboration with Jasmin Fisher I published a review on the [opportunities and challenges for executable modelling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41568-020-0258-x.pdf).

              Thanks to generous funding from the [Glover Fund](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1110119&subid=0), I was able to build upon my work on the evolution of cancer, expanding it to [understand how the behaviour of blood cancers is determined by the order in which they acquire mutations, even when their final mutational profile is identical](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33189-w.pdf) as part of a collaboration with the [Hall](https://www.hall-lab.com/research) and [Kent](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/infection-immunity/david-kent/) labs.

              As part of the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/) Mathematical Genomics and Medicine PhD programme, studied as part of the University of Cambridge Computational Biology MPhil, while also undertaking rotations in different labs. I then worked in the lab of Jasmin Fisher and the [University of Cambridge Department of Biochemistry](https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/) and [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).  During my PhD, I developed a network model of breast cancer, as well as novel methods to study combination treatment and the [evolution of cancers](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-17297-8_5). Using these, in collaboration with the Gerard Evan lab, we were able to identify and validate a [novel combination treatment for breast cancer](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1903485116), exploiting the heterogeneity observed in myc driven breast cancers.

              For my Master's thesis, I studyed the how fibroblasts sense and respond to mechanical changes in their environment, in particular in wound healing.  In the [Terentjev lab](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/terentjeve) worked on stability analysis of non-linear differential equations modelling this system, particularly focussing on [Lyapunov Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_stability).

              Reading Natural Sciences gave me the opportunity to build skills in diverse areas of science and mathematics, ranging from particle physics to experimental biology. This gave me the curiosity about how the programming underlying cell behaviour functions, and the mathematical and computational skills to pursue those questions.
