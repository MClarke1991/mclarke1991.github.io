I am driven by the desire to make a positive impact in the fields of cancer research and computational biology. I focus on how computational modelling can help us predict cancer evolution, so we can plan treatment programmes to avert or overcome resistance. 
{style="text-align: justify;"}

My passion for science began during my undergraduate studies in natural sciences at the University of Cambridge, where I developed a strong foundation in the principles of biology, physics and mathematics, and a fascination with the interface between them. I went on to earn my PhD in computational biology at Cambridge, where I refined my skills in developing complex models and algorithms. This background allows me to work at the exciting interface between biology and computer science.

It is also very important to me to share my knowledge and expertise with others. As a mentor to postdocs, PhD students, Masters students, and undergraduates, I take great pride in helping to guide and inspire the next generation of scientists.
